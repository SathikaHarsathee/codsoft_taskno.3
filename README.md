Project Overview:
This project focuses on customer churn prediction using the 'Churn_Modelling.csv' dataset. The objective is to analyze and predict whether customers will exit a service based on various features.

Data Loading and Exploration:
The dataset is loaded, and initial exploratory analysis is performed, displaying the first few rows and examining data types and missing values.

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
Irrelevant columns ('RowNumber', 'CustomerId', 'Surname') are removed, and categorical features ('Geography', 'Gender') are one-hot encoded to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the 'train_test_split' function for model evaluation.

Standardization:
Numerical features are standardized using 'StandardScaler' to enhance the performance of the machine learning model.

Random Forest Classification:
A Random Forest Classifier is implemented with specific hyperparameters for binary classification, predicting customer churn.

Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is assessed using accuracy metrics, including accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Feature Importance Visualization:
A bar chart is generated to visually represent the importance of features in predicting customer churn.

Confusion Matrix Visualization:
A heatmap of the confusion matrix is created to illustrate true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
